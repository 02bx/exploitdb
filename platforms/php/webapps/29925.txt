 # Date: 2013/11/26
 # Version : 1.0.1 - 1.5.4

 # This script is possibly vulnerable to CRLF injection attacks.
 # The problem is located in the file:
 #  /install/index.php
 #
 # Suppose you run a vulnerable website that has a member section.
 # An attacker will send an email to one of your members containing a
CRLF-crafted link.
 # This link appears to be legitimate; after all it points to your own website.
 # The link might look something like the one below:
 # http://localhost/page.php?page=%0d%0aContent-Type:
text/html%0d%0aHTTP/1.1 200 OK%0d%0aContent-Type:
